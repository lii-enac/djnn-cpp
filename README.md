Djnn is a c++ library dedicated to the programming of interactive software.
It is the result of the work from the Interactive Informatics team at ENAC http://lii.recherche.enac.fr

This library provides a new (and still incomplete) implementation of the djnn's model.

Please follow the instructions in <a href="https://github.com/lii-enac/djnn-cpp/blob/master/INSTALL.md">INSTALL.md</a> to compile it.

This library can be used through a dedicated language named Smala: http://smala.io
